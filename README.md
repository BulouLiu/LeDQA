# LeDQA

## Introduction
LeDQA is the first Chinese legal case document-based question answering dataset to our best knowledge. Specifically, we build a comprehensive question schema (including 48 element-based questions) for the Chinese civil law by legal professionals and annotate the relevant sentences to these questions in each case document. The constructed dataset originates from Chinese civil cases and contains 100 case documents, 4,800 case-question pairs and 132,048 sentence-level relevance annotations.

## Data Format

### Question Schema
The question schema can be found in `QuestionSchema.json`.
